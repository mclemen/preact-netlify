<p>This project basically trying to be a simpler, lighter, faster, Gatsbyjs alternative.</p>
<p>Main difference being that, instead of being tied to GraphQL and many more complexities to handle your data, you just use the hyperapp APIs and vanilla javascript.</p>
<p>Resulting bundles seem to be a tenth the size and few in numbers compared to Gatsby builds. There is also nearly no inherent complexity related to pre-rendering thanks to simply using puppeteer.</p>
<p>This project started out as a boilerplate but grew into a seperate package instead.</p>
<p>This site is just a demo to get the word out and potentially some help and assistance.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think on github or the hyperapp slack!</p>
<p>Feel free to open up <a href="https://github.com/loteoo/hyperstatic/issues">issues</a> if you see any possible improvements, ideas or pitfalls i&#39;m not seeing. Pull requests will also be more than welcome!</p>
