# MobileGods Tournament Bracket

This project basically trying to be a simpler, lighter, faster, Gatsbyjs alternative.

Main difference being that, instead of being tied to GraphQL and many more complexities to handle your data, you just use the hyperapp APIs and vanilla javascript.

Resulting bundles seem to be a tenth the size and few in numbers compared to Gatsby builds. There is also nearly no inherent complexity related to pre-rendering thanks to simply using puppeteer.

This project started out as a boilerplate but grew into a seperate package instead.

This site is just a demo to get the word out and potentially some help and assistance.

Let me know what you think on github or the hyperapp slack!

Feel free to open up [issues](https://github.com/loteoo/hyperstatic/issues) if you see any possible improvements, ideas or pitfalls i'm not seeing. Pull requests will also be more than welcome!
